This repository contains one R Script and two dataframes to perform and reproduce all the analyses of 'Ice age, current climate, habitat availability, and the diversity of European dragonflies and damselflies'.

The data used for the statistical analysis are stored in the ‘Data’ folder. This folder contains 2 files in CSV format, where the delimiter is ";" and the decimal separator is ".". The available files are:
